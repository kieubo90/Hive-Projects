# Pisince-Helsinki- Not Complete

This category is about I spent 1 month in Hive Helsinki coding school to learn coding, school's principal, met new people and collaborate.
Inside this article is all about projects and functions for a day that I can do as much as possible. 
The result of every single projects was not necessarily corrected. The goal was for us to get familiar with the school's process and for the staffs to select suitable students.
